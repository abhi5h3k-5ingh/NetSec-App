# Port scanning Detection App

## Capture Network Packets
For capturing the network packets we are using pcapdroid app's API. I have built an app that calls API to capture the network packet by simulating a VPN environment locally.

## NetSec
NetSec is a powerful application designed to detect and mitigate network attacks especially portscan attacks as of now. With advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, it identifies and alerts users about potential security breaches, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of their network.

## Setup Instruction
1. It is advisable to run the app in actual device instead of emulator.
